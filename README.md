# 🧠 React Concepts Playground

Welcome to the **React Concepts Playground** — a hands-on learning repository where each folder represents a key concept in React with a minimal, focused code example.

This project is designed to help developers **learn**, **practice**, and **demonstrate** how various React concepts work in isolation — including performance optimizations, hooks, patterns, and more.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder contains:

- A specific React concept
- A working example (`App.jsx` or `index.js`)
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining the concept and usage
